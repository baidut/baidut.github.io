# Hello, JB!

It's so easy to establish your free blog on github by jekyllbootstrap. I have heard jekyll, I used to think jekyllbootstrap may just be jekyll with bootstrap UI theme, After installing it, I found it more than what I expect, now, without knowing nothing about how it work, I can post my first posts using the familiar markdown mark language.

# What I know about jekyllbootstrap...

## How to post?

Create a new file under the path `_posts`, make sure the format of file name is like `"%d-%d-%d-%s.md",year,month,day,your_post_name`.

You can visit [JB's Official Introduction](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html) to know some detail. 

# HAVE FUN!
